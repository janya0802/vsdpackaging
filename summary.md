## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary: Virtual Package Modeling in Ansys Q3D
Over the course of Lectures 1 to 21, we journeyed through the complete virtual modeling of a semiconductor package using Ansys Q3D Extractor. This hands-on project introduced us to the fundamentals of package design and electromagnetic (EM) simulation.

We started by modeling the silicon die, followed by the substrate, setting the foundation for the package structure. We then added die attach material as an interface layer and designed bond pads on both the die and substrate for electrical connectivity. These pads were connected using bond wires, carefully modeled with precise positioning and gold material assignment. Finally, we encapsulated the entire structure with a mold compound, ensuring mechanical protection and allowing space for laser marking.

Along the way, we learned:

How to design 3D components using rectangles and thickness

Assigning materials like Silicon, Copper, Modified Epoxy, and Gold

Understanding the role of each layer in a package stack

The importance of geometrical accuracy for EM simulations

Why mold compound thickness matters in real-world packaging

This project gave us a clear, step-by-step understanding of IC packaging, from physical modeling to preparing for signal and thermal integrity studies. It's a great starting point for diving deeper into advanced semiconductor packaging and simulation workflows.
