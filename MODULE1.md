# 🗂️ Module 1 -  Packaging Evolution: From Basic 3D Integration

## 🔍 What is Semiconductor Packaging?

Semiconductor packaging is the **final stage of semiconductor manufacturing**, where the silicon die is encased in a protective housing and connected to the external environment.

---

## ❓ Why is Semiconductor Packaging Needed?

### 1. **Protection of Semiconductor Devices**
- The bare silicon die is extremely delicate and cannot function in open environments.
- Packaging protects it from:
  - Chemical damage
  - Humidity and moisture
  - Physical shocks and vibrations

### 2. **Connectivity & Integration**
- Packaging enables the die to communicate with the outside world through:
  - Metal pads
  - Wires
  - Solder balls (as in BGA)
- Allows stacking or connecting multiple dies in 2.5D/3D packages.
