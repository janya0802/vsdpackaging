1. **Die Attach**
2. **Curing**
3. **Wire Bonding**
4. **Molding (Transfer Molding)**
5. **Marking (Laser Marking)**
6. **Singulation (Dicing)**

---

## üß© 1. Die Attach

> Die attach is the process of fixing the semiconductor die onto the package substrate using an adhesive.

**Steps involved:**
- **Epoxy Dispensing:** A precise amount of epoxy is dispensed on the package substrate.
- **Chip Pick-up:** A robotic pick-up head selects the individual die from the wafer.
- **Placement:** The die is placed carefully on the **Die Attach Film (DAF)** located on the substrate.

This step is critical for ensuring physical stability and thermal/electrical conductivity between the chip and substrate.

---

## üî• 2. Curing

> After the die is attached, the epoxy must be **cured** (hardened) to provide a secure mechanical bond.

- The assembly is passed through a **curing oven** or subjected to **infrared (IR) heating**.
- Proper curing ensures the die doesn‚Äôt shift during further processing and maintains adhesion strength.

---

## ‚ö° 3. Wire Bonding

> Wire bonding forms the electrical connections between the **bond pads on the die** and the **bond fingers on the substrate** using fine gold or copper wires.

### Types of Bonds:
- **Ball Bonding (using gold wires)**
- **Wedge Bonding (using aluminum wires)**

### Key Steps:
1. **Wire Tail Formation:** A fine wire is fed through a capillary tool.
2. **EFO Spark (Electronic Flame-Off):** Creates a free air ball at the end of the wire.
3. **Ball Bond Formation:** The ball is pressed onto the die pad using **ultrasound and heat** to form a **strong metallurgical bond**.
4. **Wire Looping:** The capillary forms a wire loop as it moves to the substrate bond pad.
5. **Crescent Bond:** Another bond is formed on the package substrate.
6. **Wire Clipping:** The wire is cut to complete one connection.

Wire bonding is repeated for all required pads with **high speed and precision**.

---

## üß´ 4. Molding (Transfer Molding)

> After bonding, the entire die and wires are encapsulated in a **mold compound** to protect them from mechanical damage, moisture, and contaminants.

- **Resin Flow:** A thermosetting resin is injected into a mold cavity using high pressure.
- It flows around the die and wires, then solidifies on curing to form a **rigid protective shell**.

This ensures long-term reliability and robustness of the packaged device.

---

## üîç 5. Marking (Laser)

> Each packaged chip is marked using **laser etching**.

- **Laser Marking** is used to print product information, traceability codes, or logos.
- Non-contact method, fast, and suitable for high-volume manufacturing.

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è 6. Singulation (Dicing)

> This is the process of **separating individual units** from a molded array.

- A **thin dicing blade** is used to cut along the pre-defined saw streets between units.

<img width="550" height="272" alt="a0799f23-209f-47c5-b700-e7ad4106c352 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a88b855-ed0a-4869-9b73-945512cded8a" />



## üìå 1. Bump Formation on Silicon (Si)

> Bumps are tiny solder balls that form the electrical and mechanical connection between the silicon die and the substrate.

### üîπ Step-by-step bump formation:
- **Solder Deposition:** Solder is deposited on the die bond pads.
- **Before Reflow:** The solder appears as cylindrical deposits sitting on top of UBM (Under Bump Metallization).
- **Reflow:** The entire wafer is heated. The solder melts and forms spherical bumps due to surface tension.
- **After Reflow:** Rounded solder balls are formed and solidified in place.

‚úÖ **Result:** Bumps are ready for flip-chip mounting.

---

## üîÑ 2. Flipping the Chip

> The chip is flipped so that the bumps face downward and align with the bond pads on the package substrate.

This "flip" gives the packaging its name ‚Äî **Flip Chip** ‚Äî and enables direct connection without wire bonding.

---

## üíß 3. Flux Dispensing

> **Flux** is dispensed onto the substrate to clean and prepare the surface for solder bonding.

- Flux removes oxides from the metal surfaces and improves solder wetting.
- Ensures good mechanical and electrical connections during reflow.

üß™ **Flux is applied precisely** over the bond pads on the substrate using dispensing tools.

---

## üìç 4. Chip Placement

> The bumped chip is placed onto the substrate such that each bump aligns with its respective pad.

- Done using **high-precision pick-and-place** tools.
- Alignment is critical to ensure proper solder bonding.

---

## üî• 5. Solder Reflow

> The assembly is passed through a **reflow oven** to melt the solder bumps and form permanent bonds.

- The solder melts and wets both the die pads and the substrate pads.
- As it cools, a **solid metallurgical bond** forms at each bump location.

This step is similar to the reflow process used in PCB manufacturing.

---

## üí® 6. Flux Cleansing

> After reflow, **residual flux** must be removed using solvent spray.

- Cleansing prevents corrosion or contamination of the solder joints.
- Performed in a controlled environment using **chemically safe solvents**.

---

## üß¥ 7. Underfill Dispensing

> Underfill is an **epoxy resin** material that is dispensed to fill the gap between the chip and the substrate.

### Why Underfill?
- Improves **mechanical stability**.
- Reduces **stress** on solder joints due to thermal expansion mismatch.
- Enhances **moisture resistance** and **long-term reliability**.

The underfill flows under the chip by **capillary action**.

---

## ‚ô®Ô∏è 8. Underfill Cure

> The underfill material is **cured using heat** to solidify it into a strong, supportive layer.

- Curing ovens or hot plates are used.
- Ensures the chip is rigidly held in place, minimizing mechanical stress.

---

## üß± 9. Molding

> The chip and underfill assembly are **encapsulated using a protective mold compound**.

- Mold material is injected around the chip for mechanical and environmental protection.
- Prevents damage from moisture, dust, or mechanical shock.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è 10. Marking

> Final packages are marked using **laser marking systems**.

- Adds product identification, batch numbers, or branding.
- Enables traceability during manufacturing and logistics.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 11. Ball Mounting on the Substrate (BGA Balls)

> **Ball Grid Array (BGA) balls** are added on the bottom side of the package for final PCB assembly.

- The BGA balls provide interconnection between the package and the PCB.
- The pattern and pitch depend on the device application.

---

## üî• 12. Final Reflow After Ball Mounting

> The BGA balls are reflowed onto the substrate to form the final interconnects.

- This is similar to earlier solder reflow but now connects the **package to the PCB side**.
- Ensures robust connection ready for system-level integration.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Outcome

After these steps, the **Flip Chip Package** is:
- Electrically connected using **solder bumps**,
- Mechanically stabilized with **underfill**,

# üì¶ Lecture 9: Wafer Level Packaging (WLP)

Wafer Level Packaging (WLP) is a crucial advancement in the semiconductor industry that enables packaging of the die at the wafer level itself, eliminating the need for conventional packaging after dicing. WLP is especially useful in mobile and compact electronic devices due to its small form factor, improved electrical performance, and reduced cost. The most prominent type of WLP is **Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging (FOWLP)**.

<img width="550" height="271" alt="e4c3f7bd-583f-4b86-9753-513576f67eee (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b12366e5-a79a-4222-b570-4e55fb6f05e1" />


Below is a detailed explanation of each step involved in the WLP process:

---

## üåÄ Reconstitution Process

### 1. **Diced Wafer**
- The wafer is diced to separate individual dies.
- Only known good dies (KGDs), verified through prior testing, are selected for the packaging process.

### 2. **Pick and Place Known Good Dies**
- The KGDs are carefully picked and placed on a **temporary carrier**.
- This carrier acts as a support platform during the initial steps of WLP.

### 3. **Molding**
- The placed dies are encapsulated in a molding compound, creating a solid rectangular panel.
- This simulates the mechanical and thermal properties of a full wafer.
- After molding, the carrier is removed to yield the **Reconstituted Wafer**.

---

## üîÅ RDL (Redistribution Layer) Preparation

### 4. **Coating Dielectric and Metal**
- A dielectric layer is coated on the surface of the reconstituted wafer.
- Metal layers are deposited for electrical interconnections.

### 5. **1st RDL Patterning**
- The first layer of RDL is patterned using photolithography to form interconnect traces.

### 6. **Dielectric Coating and Patterning**
- Another dielectric layer is coated on top.
- Vias (contact holes) are etched to connect to the previous RDL layer.

### 7. **2nd and 3rd RDL Patterning**
- Multiple RDL layers may be added depending on the complexity of the interconnect.
- This helps in fan-out routing and improved IO density.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Final Steps

### 8. **Solder Ball Attach**
- Solder balls are attached to the topmost RDL pads to create external connections (BGA: Ball Grid Array).
- These serve as the final input/output terminals for the packaged die.

### 9. **Laser Marking and Singulation**
- The panel is marked using a laser with lot and die information.
- The reconstituted wafer is then **singulated** (cut) into individual Fan-Out Packages.

---

## üì¶ Final Product: Fan-Out Wafer Level Package (FOWLP)

- Each die now has its own package with extended IOs and improved thermal/mechanical characteristics.
- The final structure consists of:
  - Solder Balls (external connections)
  - Redistribution Layer (electrical routing)
  - Encapsulation Mold Compound (EMC)
  - The Chip (Die)

---

## üé• Reference: Video Explanation
> A detailed video was shown during the lecture which helps visualize each step in the Fan-Out WLP process.

---

**üîç Overwiew :**  
Fan-Out WLP enables high-density, high-performance, and compact packaging of ICs by redistributing the IOs over a reconstituted wafer and avoiding the limitations of traditional package substrates. This process integrates advanced photolithography, molding, and metallization to support the packaging needs of modern-day electronics.
