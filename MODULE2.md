# 📦 Module 2 : From wafers to package - assembly and manufacturing essentials 

## 🔍 1. Overview of Semiconductor Supply Chain
The semiconductor supply chain involves multiple critical stages, each contributing to the creation of the final electronic product. The entire process transforms a circuit idea into a packaged and tested IC ready to be deployed in commercial products.

## 🛠️ 2. Focus on Package Management (ATMP)

The **ATMP** stage is where *Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging* of ICs takes place. It ensures that the silicon dies are converted into usable electronic components.

- **ATMP**: Assembly, Testing, Marking & Packaging
- **OSAT**: Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test  
  - Companies: ASE, Amkor, TATA, etc.
- Can also be done **in-house** by companies like:
  - Intel
  - TSMC
  - Micron
  - Samsung
  - SK Hynix

> 🧠 *ATMP is the bridge between wafer fabrication and system-level integration. It ensures functional, reliable, and high-yield IC packaging.*
