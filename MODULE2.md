## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Focus on Package Management (ATMP)

The **ATMP** stage is where *Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging* of ICs takes place. It ensures that the silicon dies are converted into usable electronic components.

- **ATMP**: Assembly, Testing, Marking & Packaging
- **OSAT**: Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test  
  - Companies: ASE, Amkor, TATA, etc.
- Can also be done **in-house** by companies like:
  - Intel
  - TSMC
  - Micron
  - Samsung
  - SK Hynix

> üß† *ATMP is the bridge between wafer fabrication and system-level integration. It ensures functional, reliable, and high-yield IC packaging.*

## üè≠ Wafer Preparation Area ‚Äì ISO Class 7 Cleanroom

The **Wafer Preparation Area** is a critical cleanroom zone where wafers undergo multiple preprocessing steps before packaging. These operations are carried out under strict contamination control to ensure product reliability and yield.

## üßæ Step-by-Step Breakdown of Cleanroom Activities

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Incoming Wafer Carrier
- Wafers are delivered from the fab in specialized carriers known as **FOUPs (Front Opening Unified Pods)**.
- These carriers protect wafers from particles, humidity, and ESD (Electrostatic Discharge).
- Operators carefully open the FOUPs in laminar flow hoods inside ISO 7 environments to avoid contamination.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Wafer Inspection
- Optical and automated inspection tools scan wafers for defects.
- Checks are made for:
  - Surface irregularities
  - Contaminants or particles
  - Wafer ID and lot tracking
- Critical for filtering out damaged wafers before further processing.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Wafer Front Tape Lamination
- A **protective UV-sensitive tape** is laminated on the front side of the wafer.
- Purpose:
  - Shields delicate circuitry from physical damage during grinding.
  - Ensures structural integrity during handling.
- This tape can later be removed using UV exposure.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Wafer Backside Grinding
- Reduces wafer thickness (from ~700 ¬µm to ~100 ¬µm or less) to support thin-package applications.
- Grinding process:
  - Wafer is mounted face-down on a **grinding chuck**.
  - A rotating **grinding wheel** removes material from the backside.
  - Coolant and spindle force are precisely controlled to avoid cracks.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Tape Frame Mounting to Wafer Backside
- Post-grinding, the thin wafer is mounted onto a **dicing tape** held by a ring frame.
- Functions of the tape frame:
  - Secures wafer during dicing.
  - Maintains die alignment.
  - Prevents wafer breakage due to low mechanical strength.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Two-Step Wafer Dicing  
**(a) Laser Grooving**  
- Laser scribing creates shallow pre-cut grooves along scribe lines.
- Benefits:
  - Reduces mechanical stress during blade dicing.
  - Enhances die edge quality.

**(b) Blade Dicing**  
- A high-precision rotating diamond blade fully separates the individual dies.
- Conducted under water to reduce heat and wash away debris.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Final Wafer Inspection & SPC (Statistical Process Control)
- Post-dicing, each die and frame undergo:
  - Visual inspection (manual + automated vision systems).
  - Die count verification and placement accuracy.
  - Crack and chipping detection.
- **SPC Tools** monitor process metrics like blade wear, die yield, thickness, and more.
- Data is analyzed for:
  - Process drift detection
  - Outlier identification
  - Yield improvement
