- The assembly is passed through a **curing oven** or subjected to **infrared (IR) heating**.
- Proper curing ensures the die doesn’t shift during further processing and maintains adhesion strength.

---

## ⚡ 3. Wire Bonding

> Wire bonding forms the electrical connections between the **bond pads on the die** and the **bond fingers on the substrate** using fine gold or copper wires.

### Types of Bonds:
- **Ball Bonding (using gold wires)**
- **Wedge Bonding (using aluminum wires)**

### Key Steps:
1. **Wire Tail Formation:** A fine wire is fed through a capillary tool.
2. **EFO Spark (Electronic Flame-Off):** Creates a free air ball at the end of the wire.
3. **Ball Bond Formation:** The ball is pressed onto the die pad using **ultrasound and heat** to form a **strong metallurgical bond**.
4. **Wire Looping:** The capillary forms a wire loop as it moves to the substrate bond pad.
5. **Crescent Bond:** Another bond is formed on the package substrate.
6. **Wire Clipping:** The wire is cut to complete one connection.

Wire bonding is repeated for all required pads with **high speed and precision**.

---

## 🧫 4. Molding (Transfer Molding)

> After bonding, the entire die and wires are encapsulated in a **mold compound** to protect them from mechanical damage, moisture, and contaminants.

- **Resin Flow:** A thermosetting resin is injected into a mold cavity using high pressure.
- It flows around the die and wires, then solidifies on curing to form a **rigid protective shell**.

**Flip Chip Packaging** is an advanced packaging technique where the die is flipped upside down, and **solder bumps** are used to connect the chip directly to the substrate. This enables high-density, high-performance, and compact interconnects, ideal for modern electronics.

This lecture explores the **step-by-step cleanroom process** for flip chip packaging, including **bump formation, chip mounting, reflow, underfill, and molding**.

---
<img width="550" height="272" alt="a0799f23-209f-47c5-b700-e7ad4106c352 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a88b855-ed0a-4869-9b73-945512cded8a" />



## 📌 1. Bump Formation on Silicon (Si)

> Bumps are tiny solder balls that form the electrical and mechanical connection between the silicon die and the substrate.

### 🔹 Step-by-step bump formation:
- **Solder Deposition:** Solder is deposited on the die bond pads.
- **Before Reflow:** The solder appears as cylindrical deposits sitting on top of UBM (Under Bump Metallization).
- **Reflow:** The entire wafer is heated. The solder melts and forms spherical bumps due to surface tension.
- **After Reflow:** Rounded solder balls are formed and solidified in place.

✅ **Result:** Bumps are ready for flip-chip mounting.

---

## 🔄 2. Flipping the Chip

> The chip is flipped so that the bumps face downward and align with the bond pads on the package substrate.

This "flip" gives the packaging its name — **Flip Chip** — and enables direct connection without wire bonding.

---

## 💧 3. Flux Dispensing

> **Flux** is dispensed onto the substrate to clean and prepare the surface for solder bonding.

- Flux removes oxides from the metal surfaces and improves solder wetting.
- Ensures good mechanical and electrical connections during reflow.

🧪 **Flux is applied precisely** over the bond pads on the substrate using dispensing tools.

---

## 📍 4. Chip Placement

> The bumped chip is placed onto the substrate such that each bump aligns with its respective pad.

- Done using **high-precision pick-and-place** tools.
- Alignment is critical to ensure proper solder bonding.

---

## 🔥 5. Solder Reflow

> The assembly is passed through a **reflow oven** to melt the solder bumps and form permanent bonds.

- The solder melts and wets both the die pads and the substrate pads.
- As it cools, a **solid metallurgical bond** forms at each bump location.

This step is similar to the reflow process used in PCB manufacturing.

---

## 💨 6. Flux Cleansing

> After reflow, **residual flux** must be removed using solvent spray.

- Cleansing prevents corrosion or contamination of the solder joints.
- Performed in a controlled environment using **chemically safe solvents**.

---

## 🧴 7. Underfill Dispensing

> Underfill is an **epoxy resin** material that is dispensed to fill the gap between the chip and the substrate.

### Why Underfill?
- Improves **mechanical stability**.
- Reduces **stress** on solder joints due to thermal expansion mismatch.
- Enhances **moisture resistance** and **long-term reliability**.

The underfill flows under the chip by **capillary action**.

---

## ♨️ 8. Underfill Cure

> The underfill material is **cured using heat** to solidify it into a strong, supportive layer.

- Curing ovens or hot plates are used.
- Ensures the chip is rigidly held in place, minimizing mechanical stress.

---

## 🧱 9. Molding

> The chip and underfill assembly are **encapsulated using a protective mold compound**.

- Mold material is injected around the chip for mechanical and environmental protection.
- Prevents damage from moisture, dust, or mechanical shock.

---

## ✍️ 10. Marking

> Final packages are marked using **laser marking systems**.

- Adds product identification, batch numbers, or branding.
- Enables traceability during manufacturing and logistics.

---

## ⚙️ 11. Ball Mounting on the Substrate (BGA Balls)

> **Ball Grid Array (BGA) balls** are added on the bottom side of the package for final PCB assembly.

- The BGA balls provide interconnection between the package and the PCB.
- The pattern and pitch depend on the device application.

---

## 🔥 12. Final Reflow After Ball Mounting

> The BGA balls are reflowed onto the substrate to form the final interconnects.

- This is similar to earlier solder reflow but now connects the **package to the PCB side**.
- Ensures robust connection ready for system-level integration.

---

## ✅ Final Outcome

After these steps, the **Flip Chip Package** is:
- Electrically connected using **solder bumps**,
- Mechanically stabilized with **underfill**,
- Protected with **molding**, and
- Ready for integration into PCBs using **BGA balls**.

- Only known good dies (KGDs), verified through prior testing, are selected for the packaging process.

### 2. **Pick and Place Known Good Dies**
- The KGDs are carefully picked and placed on a **temporary carrier**.
- This carrier acts as a support platform during the initial steps of WLP.

### 3. **Molding**
- The placed dies are encapsulated in a molding compound, creating a solid rectangular panel.
- This simulates the mechanical and thermal properties of a full wafer.
- After molding, the carrier is removed to yield the **Reconstituted Wafer**.

---

## 🔁 RDL (Redistribution Layer) Preparation

### 4. **Coating Dielectric and Metal**
- A dielectric layer is coated on the surface of the reconstituted wafer.
- Metal layers are deposited for electrical interconnections.

### 5. **1st RDL Patterning**
- The first layer of RDL is patterned using photolithography to form interconnect traces.

### 6. **Dielectric Coating and Patterning**
- Another dielectric layer is coated on top.
- Vias (contact holes) are etched to connect to the previous RDL layer.

### 7. **2nd and 3rd RDL Patterning**
- Multiple RDL layers may be added depending on the complexity of the interconnect.
- This helps in fan-out routing and improved IO density.

---

## ⚙️ Final Steps

### 8. **Solder Ball Attach**
- Solder balls are attached to the topmost RDL pads to create external connections (BGA: Ball Grid Array).
- These serve as the final input/output terminals for the packaged die.

### 9. **Laser Marking and Singulation**
- The panel is marked using a laser with lot and die information.
- The reconstituted wafer is then **singulated** (cut) into individual Fan-Out Packages.

---

## 📦 Final Product: Fan-Out Wafer Level Package (FOWLP)

- Each die now has its own package with extended IOs and improved thermal/mechanical characteristics.
- The final structure consists of:
  - Solder Balls (external connections)
  - Redistribution Layer (electrical routing)
  - Encapsulation Mold Compound (EMC)
  - The Chip (Die)

---

## 🎥 Reference: Video Explanation
> A detailed video was shown during the lecture which helps visualize each step in the Fan-Out WLP process.
