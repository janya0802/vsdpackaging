# 🧱 Module 5 – 

Lecture 17:  Introduction to Package Cross-Section Modeling in ANSYS Electronics Desktop (AEDT)

> 🔰 *This marks the beginning of Module 5, focused on building a semiconductor package model from scratch.*

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this lecture is to understand **why and how we build a virtual model** of a package cross-section inside **ANSYS Electronics Desktop**.

The specific objective of the model is:
- To **create a virtual representation** of the **entire package stack-up** — starting from the **die** all the way to the **molding compound**.

## ❓ Why Build a Virtual Model?

During the session, the professor posed a fundamental question:

> *“Why should we build a virtual model in ANSYS?”*

The answer includes two major engineering goals:

- 🔥 **Thermal Performance Analysis**:  
  To simulate and evaluate how heat is generated and dissipated throughout the package. This ensures the package operates safely within thermal limits.

- ⚡ **Electrical Performance Assessment**:  
  To observe signal behavior, resistance, parasitics, and how electrical performance varies with package geometry and materials.

## 🧰 What’s Coming Up in This Module?

This module is **hands-on and modeling-focused**. 

- Build a **complete package cross-section** from scratch
- Work layer-by-layer through **die**, **underfill**, **substrate**, **bumps**, **balls**, and **mold compound**
- Understand how to create a **thermally and electrically aware model**
