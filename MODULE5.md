# 🧱 Module 5 – 

Lecture 17:  Introduction to Package Cross-Section Modeling in ANSYS Electronics Desktop (AEDT)

> 🔰 *This marks the beginning of Module 5, focused on building a semiconductor package model from scratch.*

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this lecture is to understand **why and how we build a virtual model** of a package cross-section inside **ANSYS Electronics Desktop**.

The specific objective of the model is:
- To **create a virtual representation** of the **entire package stack-up** — starting from the **die** all the way to the **molding compound**.

## ❓ Why Build a Virtual Model?

During the session, the professor posed a fundamental question:

> *“Why should we build a virtual model in ANSYS?”*

The answer includes two major engineering goals:

- 🔥 **Thermal Performance Analysis**:  
  To simulate and evaluate how heat is generated and dissipated throughout the package. This ensures the package operates safely within thermal limits.

- ⚡ **Electrical Performance Assessment**:  
  To observe signal behavior, resistance, parasitics, and how electrical performance varies with package geometry and materials.

# Module 5: Virtual Package Modeling in Ansys Q3D

## Lecture 18: Die and Substrate Modeling in Q3D

This lecture begins the hands-on modeling of a package cross-section in Ansys Q3D. The main objective is to virtually build the components of a package, starting with the **die** and **substrate**, and assign appropriate materials and thicknesses.

### 🧱 Step 1: Die Creation

1. **Shape Selection:**

   * Choose **Rectangle** shape from the modeling toolbar.

2. **Set Properties:**

   * **Dimensions:** `3 mm x 3 mm`
   * **Center Position (X, Y, Z):** `(0, 0, 0)`
   * **Thickness:** `0.2 mm`

3. **Make it 3D (Add Thickness):**

   * Select the rectangle → Navigate to `Modeler → Surface → Thickness Sheet`
   * Enter the desired **thickness** to convert it to a 3D volume.

5. **Rename & Material Assignment:**

   * **Rename:** `die`
   * **Material:** Change from default **Copper** to **Silicon**

---
##  🧱 Step 2  - Substrate creation 

1. **New Rectangle for Substrate:**

   * **Dimensions:** `5 mm x 5 mm`
   * **Position (X, Y, Z):** `(-1 mm, -1 mm, -0.1 mm)`

     * This centers the **die** on the **substrate**.

2. **Add Thickness:**

   * Add **thickness** of `0.5 mm`, but since the die gets covered, apply **thickness in the negative Z direction**: `-0.5 mm`.
   * This ensures the die sits above the substrate surface, not inside it.

3. **Rename & Material:**

    <img width="1318" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28fc4d36-c166-4eb8-8b2e-c620d0d89969" />


   * **Rename:** `substrate`
   * **Material:** Assign appropriate substrate material (not specified yet).

---

### 📝 Notes:

* Though initially stated as default, the **3 mm x 3 mm** die size is actually **custom-defined** in this model.
* The relative Z-positions are carefully chosen to prevent overlap of die and substrate.
* Accurate material assignment is important for simulation (e.g., **Silicon** for die).

Lecture 19: Die Attach and Bond Pad Modeling

This lecture introduces two important components in the package: the die attach material and bond pads for wire bonding.

🧩 Step 3: Die Attach Modeling

Update Substrate Position:

Modify substrate Z-position from -0.1 mm to -0.1 mm (same), which creates space between the die and substrate.

 <img width="1090" height="564" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b6ca2ff-f144-40f3-a001-9e2644bccfe9" />


Create Die Attach Rectangle:

Position (X, Y, Z): (0 mm, 0 mm, 0 mm)

X/Y Dimensions: 3 mm x 3 mm

Thickness: -0.1 mm

Rename & Material:

Rename: die_attach

Material: Modified Epoxy

 <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e768f98-09d2-48cf-b326-8acd2990a142" />

🔗 Step 4: Bond Pad Creation

Bond wires are created between two bond pads: one on the die and one on the substrate.

🟨 Die Bond Pad

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb751962-8dcf-49fd-80f6-f01ccf4d7533" />

Create Rectangle:

X/Y Dimensions: 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm

Position: (0.2 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.2 mm)

Thickness: 0.005 mm

Rename & Material:

Rename: die_bond_pad

Material: Copper

🟩 Substrate Bond Pad

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb0bc67a-35c0-42d0-a330-2d15b4de103e" />

Create Rectangle:

X/Y Dimensions: 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm

Position: (0.2 mm, -0.8 mm, -0.1 mm)

Rename & Material:

Rename: substrate_bond_pad

Material: Copper

📝 Notes:

The die attach ensures mechanical and thermal connection between die and substrate.

Bond pads are necessary for wire bonding, connecting signals between die and substrate.

Positioning and material selection are key for realistic EM simulation.



##📝  Lecture 20: Bond Wire Creation

In this lecture, we connect the two bond pads created earlier using a bond wire.

🧵 Step 5: Bond Wire Creation

Select Tool:

Navigate to Draw → Bond Wire

Create Wire:

Start drawing from the die bond pad and stretch it to the middle of the substrate bond pad.

Use default values for bond wire geometry.

Material Assignment:

Assign Material: Gold

📝 Notes:

Bond wire is essential for making electrical connections between die and substrate.

Proper placement and material selection (gold) is key to ensure signal integrity and realistic EM simulation.

In the next lecture, we may explore additional layers or complete interconnect paths within the package.

## 📝 Lecture 21: Mold Compound Creation

In this final lecture, we complete the package by creating the mold compound that encapsulates the structure.

🏰 Step 6: Mold Compound Modeling

Create Mold Rectangle:

Position (X, Y, Z): (-1 mm, -1 mm, -0.1 mm)

X/Y Dimensions: 5 mm x 5 mm

Thickness: 1.2 mm

Rename & Material:

Rename: mold_compound

Material: Epoxy_Kevlar_XY

📖 Why Mold Thickness > Bond Wire Height?

Reason: Laser marking is performed on the top of each package during final packaging.

During this marking, a small area of the top surface is affected.

If the bond wires are too close to the top surface, they risk being damaged.

Therefore, sufficient mold compound thickness ensures protection of bond wires from laser disturbance
