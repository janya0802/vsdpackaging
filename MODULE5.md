# 🧱 Module 5 – 

Lecture 17:  Introduction to Package Cross-Section Modeling in ANSYS Electronics Desktop (AEDT)

> 🔰 *This marks the beginning of Module 5, focused on building a semiconductor package model from scratch.*

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this lecture is to understand **why and how we build a virtual model** of a package cross-section inside **ANSYS Electronics Desktop**.

The specific objective of the model is:
- To **create a virtual representation** of the **entire package stack-up** — starting from the **die** all the way to the **molding compound**.

## ❓ Why Build a Virtual Model?

During the session, the professor posed a fundamental question:

> *“Why should we build a virtual model in ANSYS?”*

The answer includes two major engineering goals:

- 🔥 **Thermal Performance Analysis**:  
  To simulate and evaluate how heat is generated and dissipated throughout the package. This ensures the package operates safely within thermal limits.

- ⚡ **Electrical Performance Assessment**:  
  To observe signal behavior, resistance, parasitics, and how electrical performance varies with package geometry and materials.

## 🧰 What’s Coming Up in This Module?

This module is **hands-on and modeling-focused**. 

- Build a **complete package cross-section** from scratch
- Work layer-by-layer through **die**, **underfill**, **substrate**, **bumps**, **balls**, and **mold compound**
- Understand how to create a **thermally and electrically aware model**

# Module 5: Virtual Package Modeling in Ansys Q3D

## Lecture 18: Die and Substrate Modeling in Q3D

This lecture begins the hands-on modeling of a package cross-section in Ansys Q3D. The main objective is to virtually build the components of a package, starting with the **die** and **substrate**, and assign appropriate materials and thicknesses.

### 🧱 Step 1: Die Creation

1. **Shape Selection:**

   * Choose **Rectangle** shape from the modeling toolbar.

2. **Set Properties:**

   * **Dimensions:** `3 mm x 3 mm`
   * **Center Position (X, Y, Z):** `(0, 0, 0)`
   * **Thickness:** `0.2 mm`

3. **Make it 3D (Add Thickness):**

   * Select the rectangle → Navigate to `Modeler → Surface → Thickness Sheet`
   * Enter the desired **thickness** to convert it to a 3D volume.

5. **Rename & Material Assignment:**

   * **Rename:** `die`
   * **Material:** Change from default **Copper** to **Silicon**

### 📦 Step 2: Substrate Creation

1. **New Rectangle for Substrate:**

   * **Dimensions:** `5 mm x 5 mm`
   * **Position (X, Y, Z):** `(-1 mm, -1 mm, -0.1 mm)`

     * This centers the **die** on the **substrate**.

2. **Add Thickness:**

   * Add **thickness** of `0.5 mm`, but since the die gets covered, apply **thickness in the negative Z direction**: `-0.5 mm`.
   * This ensures the die sits above the substrate surface, not inside it.

3. **Rename & Material:**

   * **Rename:** `substrate`
   * **Material:** Assign appropriate substrate material (not specified yet).

---

### 📝 Notes:

* Though initially stated as default, the **3 mm x 3 mm** die size is actually **custom-defined** in this model.
* The relative Z-positions are carefully chosen to prevent overlap of die and substrate.
* Accurate material assignment is important for simulation (e.g., **Silicon** for die).
